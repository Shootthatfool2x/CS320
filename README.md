How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure my code is functional and secure I can run static and dynamic tests. 
I can ensure the code is working as intended by creating and running JUint tests. I can 
run the code and check the output for the end results. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

After meeting with the client, I will create a user needs report. It will contain everything
i have identified as a requirement. I will then code each section and follow the report like a list. 

How do I approach designing software?

I like ot approach designing software in steps. I lay out what the goal is, then break it down into 
smaller sections. Doing this allows me to create smaller goals or milestones.
